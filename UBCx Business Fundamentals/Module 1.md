A successful company starts with a strong “Why”: a reason for being.
A “Why” alone is not enough. It needs to connect to the consumer in a direct and resonant way: enter the value proposition canvas.
The “fit” on the value proposition canvas depends on:
- your product or service **fulfilling the job** customers hire it for;
- **avoiding the pain** customers normally suffer with respect to that job;
- and **capturing gains** for the customer.

Each company has circles: why inside how inside what.
Example: tesla
- why - do make world better though design and technology
- how - buy building more efficient products
- what - electric cars

From customer perspective bussines built from 3 pieses:
Job that need to be done, pains and gains from your services.
And when you have complete picture of those, you can start with word 'fit'.

Example job: shoes
- shoe A, regular sneekers, cheap, their job just for wearing, practical purpose
- shoe B, yeeze(still sneekers), 220$ per pair, their job is fashion, social purpose

Example pain: slightly sweetened (didnt get it at all)
tea + sugar + honey = im proud of drinking it.
there wasn't natural product on the market

Explanation of gain: kinship (im so cool cause im sure that this is healthy), and it has same price as soda, smooth transaction. And customers believe that they will lose weight cause of that product. 

Bussiness proposition template:
To [Customer], we offer [product or service], that [value], unlike [competitors].
